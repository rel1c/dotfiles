# Header line: explain the commit in one line (use the imperative)
#
# Common summary types: {feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore}
#
# Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things
# in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue
# being fixed, etc etc.
# 
# The body of the commit message can be several paragraphs, and
# please do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than about
# 74 characters or so. That way "git log" will show things
# nicely even when it's indented.
# 
# Make sure you explain your solution and why you're doing what you're
# doing, as opposed to describing what you're doing. Reviewers and your
# future self can read the patch, but might not understand why a
# particular solution was implemented.
